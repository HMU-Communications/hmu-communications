  <h2 class="non-event">What Makes Us Unique</h2>

<div class="event">
<p>We use AI to collect and analyze patients’ medical history. In minutes, users can receive referral to the appropriate healthcare offering from the broad range of choices presented.</p>
<p>We also directly handle the billing process and payment. Not only are patients able to make payments immediately through us, but we can also submit claims to insurance carriers with little input needed from patients or physicians.</p>
<p>Personalized care is very important to us, and we ensure that strong connections are made between patients and clinical teams based on their healthcare needs. Virtual care can be accessed from anywhere, on any device.</p>
<p>We serve patients of all ages, and just as adults are referred to physicians based on their needs, children are connected with pediatricians.</p>
<p>We connect consumers from all over the world, so to overcome language barriers, we use intelligence to match patients and physicians sharing a native language. </p>
